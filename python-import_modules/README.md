# Python - Import & Modules



## Introduction

This repository contains a set of Python scripts that illustrate the concepts of importing functions, using modules, handling command line arguments, and working with exceptions in Python. Each script focuses on a specific topic and provides practical examples to help you understand and apply these concepts effectively.

## Learning Objectives

By working through the scripts in this repository, you will learn:

- The basics of Python programming and its advantages.
- How to import functions from external files and modules.
- Proper usage of imported functions.
- Creating and utilizing custom modules.
- Exploring the built-in `dir()` function.
- Techniques to prevent code execution when imported.
- Command line argument handling in Python programs.
- The distinction between errors and exceptions.
- Using and handling exceptions to write robust code.
- The importance of raising exceptions and implementing cleanup actions.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into directories, each representing a specific topic or task. Here's a quick overview of the available scripts:

1. **0-add.py:** Import a simple function from "add_0.py" and print the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3.

2. **1-args.py:** Print the number and list of arguments passed to the script.

3. **2-variable_load.py:** Import and print the value of the variable `a` from "variable_load_2.py".

4. **3-safe_print_division.py:** Define a function to safely divide two integers and print the result.

5. **4-raise_exception.py:** Define a function to raise a type exception.

6. **5-raise_exception_msg.py:** Define a function to raise a name exception with a message.

Each script contains detailed comments and explanations to guide you through the code.
