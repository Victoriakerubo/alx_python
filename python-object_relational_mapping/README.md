# Python - Object-Relational Mapping

This project aims to explore the integration of Python with databases using Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) concepts. By utilizing the MySQLdb and SQLAlchemy modules, you will be able to interact with a MySQL database and perform various operations without writing raw SQL queries.

## Background Context

In this project, you will combine the worlds of Databases and Python to create a seamless interaction between the two.

The project is divided into two parts:

1. **Using MySQLdb**: This part involves connecting to a MySQL database using the MySQLdb module and executing SQL queries.

2. **Using SQLAlchemy (ORM)**: The second part introduces the use of SQLAlchemy, an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM). ORM abstracts the storage details and allows you to work with database records as Python objects, eliminating the need for direct SQL queries. This provides flexibility in changing storage types without altering the codebase.
